Hey, You!
The one who downloaded this mod. Thank you!

Also, if there are problems with the mod please tell me and I shall do my best to fix it. Though, please know the bugs in android are different from the ones in computer.

I also apologize if I seem too stupid with these type of mod. It was my first weapon mod.
And please if you see this mod somewhere else other than Nexus. Tell me.

Some of this weapons will only be sold once you've had enough friendship points with a certain NPC or at a certain season.
If you need something, ping me at discord 'Immortal Prince#6922'.

Thank you Ren8059, for telling me my mistake in this mod. (You'll know it if you had this before a certain version or at least if you read all of this.)

Also, please do know that I do not know how to deal with the bugs of this mod concerning the multiplayer, sorry. *obviously loud, but inaudible very dramatic cry*

Known Bugs: (On mobile. I only play SV in Android, and these mods are also made and tested in the same platform.)
This is for mobile:

So Koucya decided that we make a new mod that would make use of the bonus item of this.

With this quarantine, our school's calendar of events was ruined.
This also means that my connection with Koucya will be broken until this pandemic settles down and everything returns to normal. Me and Koucya will most definitely go separate ways after this.
So this mod is now fully under my control. However, it still depends on what will happen next school year. Since, we'll both be going in one school, I hope we're no longer classmates.

I am bored, so have some update. Don't expect too much though, I changed my phone. 
This one is too difficult to manage. Can't make too much stuff.
