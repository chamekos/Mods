To make our map edit more compatible, Sundrop has the ability to dynamically select a different patch depending on other mods you have installed
These patches are mod-specific, except for the default Vanilla patch.

If no patch is available for your mod, but there are issues with the default patch, please report it so we can fix this issue!
