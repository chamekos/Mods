-Stardew Valley 1.4 introduces changes that will affect 'Price Balancing' and 'Taxes' for just multiplayer.
(Longevity is not supported for any SDV multiplayer, currently; use with caution)

-New vanilla NPC animations have been added. Using DNPCC may result in NPCs using blank animiations or erroring.

-New vanilla items have created conflicts with MCM data. I have updated the MCM data files to fix this.
For current saved games, I have included a process within Longevity that will update/fix MCM items (a new game will not need this).


***PLEASE BACK UP YOUR SAVED GAMES BEFORE USING LONGEVITY!
