Fall Green is installed by default. To switch to Fall Orange, you will need to replace the "fall_z_wtd_tilesheet.png" with the orange version in the "alternates" folder.

Step by step:
1 - delete the file "fall_z_wtd_tilesheet.png" in the "assets" folder.
2 - open the "alternates" folder and copy the file you want: "*-o" for orange fall or "*-g" for green fall
3 - paste the file into the main "assets" folder
4 - rename the fall tilesheet to remove the "-o" or "-g" from the end of the name. the final file name needs to be "fall_z_wtd_tilesheet.png" or the mod will fail to load
