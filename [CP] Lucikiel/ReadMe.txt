Arknir's Guide to Lucikiel

Stardew Valley Expanded update!
Fixed the schedules and events to match all the new maps.

Heart Events Guide:
- 0 Heart: Talk to Lucikiel once and enter town from 6:00 am - 5:30 pm, must be sunny
- 2 Heart: Enter Forest from 6:00 am - 7:00 pm, must be sunny
- 4 Heart: Enter Blacksmith from 9:00 am - 4:00 pm
- 6 Heart: Enter Mine from 9:00 am - 6:00 pm
- 8 Heart: Enter Beach from 8:00 pm - 11:50 pm, must not be raining

[UPDATE 1.4]
Ten Hearts Guide:
**The final chapter. This time, your choices matter and determine the outcome of the story. There are two endings - true good ending, and the bad ending.
- You must have seen the 8 Heart event to trigger the 10 Heart events.
- Upon reaching the 10 Heart requirements, Clint will visit the farm house and ask you to go to the forest at night. He suggests you take off any glow rings. (If you don't have any, then perfect.)
- Enter the Forest from 8:00 pm - 11:50 pm, must not be raining. 
	- You will see a Junimo trying to stop Lucikiel from entering the Woods. You will need an upgraded steel axe to remove the fallen log to follow him.
- Enter the Woods from 8:00 pm - 11:50 pm, must not be raining.
	- Choose wisely and follow your heart. Important decisions.
*The two endings have branching paths with different consequences. You will be notified if you run into the bad ending. The best events I've ever coded ever.

MARRIAGE SCHEDULES:
Lucikiel has three work days during the week. He leaves the farm house on Mondays (work), Fridays (work & hang-outs), and Saturdays (work-out at the gym) || NOTE: Interfering with time using the CJB Cheats Menu Mod will occasionally stop Lucikiel from continuing his marriage-work schedule. 

SPOUSE UPDATE:
- You can now interact with various objects in Lucikiel's Spouse Room
	- Ezekiel has been added. If you have a male child, he will grow up to become a cute Baby Zeke (A playable character from King's Raid and Lucikiel's canonical son).
	- Takes about 60 in-game days for child to mature into Ezekiel's toddler sprite.
- Added much more immersive dialogue.
**Standing in the circle of Lucikiel's Spouse Room lets you regenerate Stamina quickly, but ONLY in multi-player mode. ;)
