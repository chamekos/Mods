# list-mods

This mods it's only a compiled version of all mods I use, but I encourage to you download nexus to valorize the work of the modders


for those don't know git and want only download the updates:

install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
open terminal
write the command:
 ```
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods
```

execute this command first time

```git
git clone https://github.com/chamekos/list-mods.git
```

done you already installed all mods

to get the updated open the terminal on the mods folders

```git
git pull origin master
```
