		"377777": "Dear Journal,^The voices have calmed down a lot since moving to the valley. But the nightmares are getting worse, I'm used to them but it does get annoying having them so often.^Harvey wants me to try this medication that's supposed to help reduce them. But I'm really nervous about taking pills.^I guess I should just suck it up and try them though, can't feel better if I don't start trusting people.^-Nikolai",
		"399999": "Dear Journal,^The figures are back. They don't say anything, they just stand in the corner of my house and stare at me.^It's really frightening to deal with it, everytime they go away I think it's finally over but they always come back.^I should tell someone but I'm nervous, I don't want to be called names.^-Nikolai",
		"322210": "Dear Journal,^I think Lewis is out to get me and Sam. No matter what we do he's getting onto us.^He came to my house today and knocked for a little while.^I didn't answer the door, I don't think he's safe to talk to alone.^Sam says he's just collecting taxes or something, but I think differently.^Besides I told him I would go to him, I don't want him on my property.^-Nikolai",
		"322211": "Dear Journal,^My benefits are being increased, it's only by ten gold. But every bit of money helps.^I've been trying to take online classes to learn a trade, so I can work again.^But I can't seem to focus on it. I won't give up though.^-Nikolai",
		"322212": "Dear Journal,^My mom has been on my mind a lot lately. I really miss her like all the time.^She was my bestfriend and she understood me and my problems.^She never judged me either.^The valley is pretty cool to live in, but I have a feeling like some of the people hate me. Even if they're nice, I bet they do.^I won't confront them though. People hardly even tell the truth.^-Nikolai",
