How to install :

-Make sure you have the two dependency mods installed, PyTK and TMXLoader. **USE UNOFFICIAL UPDATES FOUND HERE: https://community.playstarbound.com/threads/updating-mods-for-stardew-valley-1-4.156000/page-26#post-3354284** Check smapi.io/mods for the latest compatibility information.
-Unzip [TMX] Bathroom Furniture into your Mods folder.

How to use it :

By default, the TMXLoader hotkey for accessing buildables is F2. This can be changed from the TMXLoader config file, which will appear after you've run the game once with the mod installed.
Pressing F2/your chosen hotkey will pull up the Buildables menu on the lower right side of your screen. From there, choose any of the furniture and place it where you want it. The furniture can be placed indoors or outdoors and should work fine in custom locations. The prices will differ depending on the item.
MOVING THE FURNITURE: You'll have to remove it using the buildables menu first (the tab on the right, or by pressing backspace), then place it again in your new location. TMX buildables can't be rotated like furniture added by custom furniture packs, as they're essentially placing a small map inside an existing game map. If I can work out a bug with TMXL, there will be a vertical bathtub added in a future update.

FEATURES: 

Place a floor warp that when you walk on, will teleport you to its designated area. They are one way teleporters.
