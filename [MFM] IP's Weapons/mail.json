( I was the one who coded and tested them all. That Koucya only helped in making 21 or something sprites. I was just referring to the number of sprites I personally made. )^ The recipe for the Pudding and the Energy Drink will both be sold by Gus.^ However, in order to unlock the I recipe for the Energy Drink you need to have seven hearts with Harvey (Or change the requirement in the object file.)^ The Glass Bottle is being sold by Clint, though.^^  -Immortal Prince^^ P.S.
